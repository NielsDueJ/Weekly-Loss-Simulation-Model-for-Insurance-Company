# Weekly-Loss-Simulation-Model-for-Insurance-Company

This project simulates the total weekly loss experienced by an insurance company based on the number of policies that experience a loss during a week and the amount of each loss. The model incorporates statistical distributions to represent the randomness and variability in the number of policies and the amount of each loss. The actuaries at an insurance company need to model the total losses experienced during a week.

The mean weekly loss provides an estimate of the average loss the insurance company can expect.
The 90% confidence interval gives a range within which the true mean weekly loss is likely to fall with 90% confidence.
The histogram visualizes the distribution of total weekly losses.
The probabilities provide insights into the likelihood of extreme loss scenarios.
